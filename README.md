Langton_Ant_Sim
This is a simple C++ console app that runs a zoo tycoon simulator. The purpose of this project was to explore the OOP concepts of
polymorphism and virtual functions. That and have fun making virtual cash with virtual animals.

Usage
First, ensure you have the g++ compiler installed. Then git clone this repo and run make. This will create an executable,
zooTycoon.exe, that will run the simulation. Just follow the on-screen instructions from there.
Once you are done, make clean will remove the .o and executable files.
