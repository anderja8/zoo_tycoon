# Zoo Tycoon Console Clone
This is a simple C++ console app that runs a zoo tycoon simulator. The purpose of this project was to explore the OOP concepts of
polymorphism and virtual functions. That and have fun making virtual cash with virtual animals.

# Usage
First, ensure you have the g++ compiler installed. Then git clone this repo and run make. This will create an executable,
zooTycoon.exe, that will run the simulation. Just follow the on-screen instructions from there.
Once you are done, make clean will remove the .o and executable files.
