# Description: Simulates the video game zoo tycoon where the user
# owns a zoo. The zoo spends money to feed the animals, gets a payoff
# from attendance based on the animals, lets the user buy new animals,
# and deals with random zoo events like sickness, births, and
# attendance booms.

# This makefile is inspired by the example makefile from Oregon State.
